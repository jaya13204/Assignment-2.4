1. Explain the importance of Name node in Hadoop cluster


Cluster is the collection of particular set of objects based upon their characteristics and 
aggregating them  according to their similarities.Hadoop cluster boosts the speed of
data analysis applications.A computer cluster used for Hadoop is called Hadoop Cluster. 
Hadoop cluster is designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of 
unstructured data.

    Name Node:
                     
                     *Name node is also known as master and stores only metadata of HDFS.
                     *Name node is so critical to HDFS and when the name node is down.HDFS/Hadoop cluster is
                       inaccessible.
                     *When namenode goes down the file system will go offline.
                     *Name node is the centerpiece of HDFS.
                     *Name node is a single point of failure in hadoop cluster.
                     
                     *Name node contains Hadoop Filesystem tree.
                     *It contains in-memory mapping of which blocks are  stored in which data node.
                     *It knows the list of blocks and its location for any given file in HDFS.Using this 
                       information name node knows how to construct the file from blocks.
                     *Name node does not store data of the file itself.
                     *Name node has the advantage of high availability.
